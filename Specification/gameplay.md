# Stats Mafia Game Mechanics

1. Initialise all game participants
   - Set up initial settings
     - How many dice are thrown per round
     - How many rounds there will be
     - How many biased dice will be handed out
     - Number of failed guesses permitted
   - Enter their names
   - Explain game rules
2. Complete 5 rounds of gameplay
   - At the start of each round, each player's rolls are completed
   - In each round, a new statistical tool is given to the players to help them make their deduction. For example:
     - In the first round, the players get no help
     - Second round we may suggest using summary statistics (sample mean, variance, etc.)
     - In the third round, we may introduce data visualisation tools
     - This continues until Kirollos runs out of ideas of different tools to help them figure out the imposters
     - The team get to discuss the results for up to 3 minutes before having to vote
   - At the end of each round the team get to vote
     - They can either vote for a specific person, or to skip the vote
     - Every incorrect guess they make loses them a life, and they only have a limited number of lives (this can be customised in the settings)
     - If they guess the imposters correctly, they win
3. If the game ends too quickly, we can pivot to a social or a discussion about some arbitrary stats topic
